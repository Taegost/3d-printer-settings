# Resin-Profiles
All of the different resin profiles and configurations for my 3d printer (Anycubic Photon S)

These are ChituBox profiles (for now, that may change/expand in the future)
The _AnyCubic_Photon_support.cfg file are my support settings, based off of the settings used by 3dPrintingPro (His Youtube channel has a lot of excellent videos, including a great tutorial on how to set up structures for miniatures.  You can find his channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbv2mDrRqXovPdahRyoCFhA)

I'm really surprised regarding the Elegoo Rapid Grey settings, I was getting a lot of overexposure even as low as 8s exposure time, so after upgrading to firmware v5.0.2 and running the updated Photon S RERF.pws (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3973475), it looks like 4-5s is the optimal time for that resin on my printer.
At the time I'm writing this, I have a 4s exposure w/40s initial exposure time, but in the printer as I'm writing this I updated to 5s exposure and 35s initial exposure, if it works well, I'll commit it to the repo.

If you have any questions about my settings, feel free to reach out to me via e-mail (taegost@gmail.com) or on Reddit u/Taegost
